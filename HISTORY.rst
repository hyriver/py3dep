0.19.0 (2025-01-17)
-------------------

Users are encouraged to using the new HyRiver package called Seamless3DEP
which is a lightweight and efficient package providing access to both static
DEMs and dynamic 3DEP services. This package is a part of the HyRiver software
stack and is the recommended package for accessing 3DEP data. For more information
please visit its `documentation <https://seamless-3dep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
For the time being, Py3DEP will be maintained for bug fixes and minor updates.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The default CRS for ``get_map`` is now ``EPSG:5070``.
  This is due to an issue with the 3DEP service where the service
  returns invalid results when the requested CRS in not in a projected
  coordinate system.

0.18.0 (2024-10-05)
-------------------

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Drop support for Python 3.8 since its end-of-life date is October 2024.
- Remove all exceptions from the main module and raise them from the
  ``exceptions`` module. This is to declutter the public API and make
  it easier to maintain.

0.17.1 (2024-09-14)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- A release without change to match the version of other HyRiver packages.

0.17.0 (2024-05-07)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add the ``exceptions`` module to the high-level API to declutter
  the main module. In the future, all exceptions will be raised from
  this module and not from the main module. For now, the exceptions
  are raised from both modules for backward compatibility.
- Switch to using the ``src`` layout instead of the ``flat`` layout
  for the package structure. This is to make the package more
  maintainable and to avoid any potential conflicts with other
  packages.
- Add artifact attestations to the release workflow.

0.16.3 (2024-04-24)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- In ``check_3dep_availability`` function, fix a bug where the function fails to
  return a valid response when the web service is down.

0.16.2 (2024-02-12)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- In ``add_elvation`` function, fix a bug where the function fails to add
  elevation to a ``xarray.Dataset`` with x and y dims not being ``x`` and ``y``.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Refactor ``fill_depressions`` function by porting the code from ``pyflwdir``
  and improve its performance and also now, it directly support ``xarray.DataArray``.
  Now, ``pyflwdir`` is not an optional dependency anymore. You can install ``numba``
  to improve the performance of the function.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The AirMap service has been deprecated and removed from the package. The
  ``elevation_bycoords`` function now only supports the the National Map and
  the 3DEP services.

0.16.1 (2024-01-15)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- In the ``check_3dep_availability`` function when the web service is down
  the function raises a ``TypeError`` instead of setting the value of the
  failed resolution to ``Failed``. This is fixed now. (:issue_3dep:`66`).

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Simplify the logic of adding elevation to a Dataset in the
  ``add_elevation`` function to avoid modifying CRS of the input
  Dataset.

0.16.0 (2024-01-03)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new function called ``get_map_vrt`` for getting DEM
  within a bounding box and saving it as a ``VRT`` file. This
  function has low memory usage and is useful for cases where
  the DEM is needed for a large area. Moreover, even for usual
  use cases it can be much faster than ``get_dem`` since it
  loads the data lazily, at the cost of higher disk usage.
- In the ``get_map`` function, check if the input geometry is
  within the bounds of the 3DEP's WMS service and if not, raise
  an exception.
- In the ``fill_depressions`` function add a new argument called
  ``outlets`` for specifying outlet detection method: At the edge
  of all cells (``edge``) or only the minimum elevation edge cell
  (``min``; default).
- Significantly improve the performance of ``check_3dep_availability``
  function by minimizng the number of requests to the service and
  sending all requests asynchronously. Also, the returned ``dict`` now
  uses ``Failed`` for those resolutions where the service fails to
  return a valid response. It will remove the failed responses from
  the cache, so next time the function is called, it will try to
  get only the failed resolutions.
- Add four new options to ``add_elevation``: ``mask`` for passing a
  mask and ``resolution`` for specifying the resolution of the source
  DEM, and ``x_dim`` and ``y_dim`` for passing the names of spatial
  dimensions in the input dataset. The ``mask`` option is useful for
  cases where the input ``xarray.DataArray`` or ``xarray.Dataset`` has
  a mask and the user wants to use that mask for the elevation data as well.
  The ``resolution`` option is useful for cases where the user wants
  to get the elevation data at a higher resolution that will be
  downsampled by bilinear interpolation to the resolution of the input
  ``xarray.DataArray`` or ``xarray.Dataset``. The default is
  ``resolution=None`` which means the resolution of the input
  ``xarray.DataArray`` or ``xarray.Dataset`` will be used. The ``x_dim``
  and ``y_dim`` options are useful for cases where the input
  ``xarray.DataArray`` or ``xarray.Dataset`` has different names for
  spatial dimensions than ``x`` and ``y``. The default is ``x_dim="x"``
  and ``y_dim="y"``.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- In the ``elevation_profile`` function remove the ``res`` argument
  and use 10-m resolution DEM from 3DEP. Also, add two new attributes
  to the output ``xarray.Dataset``: ``source`` for the dataset to
  state the data source used and ``units`` for the ``distance`` variable
  to state the units of the distance, which is meters.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Improve initial load time by moving ``import pyflwdir`` to the
  ``fill_depressions`` function.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Decrease the number of pixels per request from 10e6 to 8e6 to reduce the
  request load (:issue_3dep:`65`).

0.15.2 (2023-09-22)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Remove dependency on ``dask``.

0.15.1 (2023-09-02)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fix HyRiver libraries requirements by specifying a range instead
  of exact version so ``conda-forge`` can resolve the dependencies.

0.15.0 (2023-05-07)
-------------------
From release 0.15 onward, all minor versions of HyRiver packages
will be pinned. This ensures that previous minor versions of HyRiver
packages cannot be installed with later minor releases. For example,
if you have ``py3dep==0.14.x`` installed, you cannot install
``pydaymet==0.15.x``. This is to ensure that the API is
consistent across all minor versions.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- In ``static_3dep_dem`` use ``rioxarray`` directly instead of
  ``rasterio`` since it can handle VRT files.
- Improve performance and accuracy of ``add_elevation`` by using
  the dynamic 3DEP service and setting the resolution based on the
  input ``xarray.DataArray`` or ``xarray.Dataset``.
- Improve the performance of ``elevation_profile`` by using the
  static 3DEP service when the input resolution is 10 m (which is
  the default for this function).
- For now, retain compatibility with ``shapely<2`` while supporting
  ``shapley>=2``.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- In ``add_elevation``, ensure that the resolution is in meters
  by reprojecting the input dataset to 5070 before extracting
  resolution and bound attributes.

0.14.0 (2023-03-05)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new function called ``add_elevation`` for adding elevation
  data as a new variable to an input ``xarray.DataArray`` or
  ``xarray.Dataset``.
- The ``elevation_bycoords`` function now accepts a single coordinate
  and returns a float in addition to a list of coordinates that returned
  a list of elevations.
- Modify the ``elevation_bycoords`` function to use the new elevation
  point query service (EPQS) web service. This only affects the
  ``source="tnm"`` option.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Bump the minimum required version of ``shapely`` to 2.0,
  and use its new API.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Sync all minor versions of HyRiver packages to 0.14.0.

0.13.12 (2023-02-01)
--------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use `pyflwdir <https://github.com/Deltares/pyflwdir>`__ package for
  depression filling operation instead of ``richdem`` since it appears
  to be unmaintained. Note that ``pyflwdir`` is an optional dependency.
  Also, ``pyflwdir`` depends on ``numba`` which is not available for
  Python 3.11 yet. You can follow the progress of ``numba``'s support
  for Python 3.11 `here <https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/8304>`__.
- Add a new function called ``get_dem`` for obtaining DEM that is a wrapper of
  ``static_3dep_dem`` and ``get_map`` functions. Since ``static_3dep_dem``
  is faster, if the requested resolution is 10 m, 30 m, or 60 m,
  ``static_3dep_dem`` will be used. Otherwise, ``get_map`` will be used.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Significantly improve the performance of ``elevation_bycoords`` when
  ``tep`` is used as the source by using the static DEM data instead of
  the dynamic DEM.
- Fully migrate ``setup.cfg`` and ``setup.py`` to ``pyproject.toml``.
- Convert relative imports to absolute with ``absolufy-imports``.
- Sync all patch versions of HyRiver packages to x.x.12.

0.13.10 (2023-01-08)
--------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Refactor the ``show_versions`` function to improve performance and
  print the output in a nicer table-like format.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fix a compatibility issue with the new ``scipy`` version in
  ``elevation_profile`` where led to failure of interpolation.

0.13.9 (2022-12-15)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Add the missing annotation import to the ``cache_keys`` to ensure
  Python 3.8 and 3.9 work with Python 3.10 style type hinting.

0.13.8 (2022-12-09)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new function called ``static_3dep_dem`` for getting only DEM
  data at 10 m, 30, or 60 m resolution. This is useful for cases where
  only DEM data (i.e., not slope, aspect, or other terrain attributes that
  the Dynamic 3DEP service provides) is needed. This function is faster
  than ``get_map`` but is less flexible.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Modify the codebase based on `Refurb <https://github.com/dosisod/refurb>`__
  suggestions.

0.13.7 (2022-11-04)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use ``pyupgrade`` package to update the type hinting annotations
  to Python 3.10 style.
- Bump the minimum required version of HyRiver dependencies to the
  latest versions.

0.13.6 (2022-08-30)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add the missing PyPi classifiers for the supported Python versions.

0.13.5 (2022-08-29)
-------------------

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Append "Error" to all exception classes for conforming to PEP-8 naming conventions.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Increase the pixel limit for 3DEP's WMS from 8M to 10M to reduce number
  of service calls and improve performance.
- Bump the minimum versions of ``pygeoogc`` and ``pygeoutils`` to 0.13.5 and that of
  ``async-retriever`` to 0.3.5.


0.13.3 (2022-06-25)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fix a bug in ``check_3dep_availability`` where due to changes in ``pygeoogc``
  ``ZeroMatched`` exception is raised instead of ``TypeError`` and as a result
  ``check_3dep_availability`` was not working as expected.

0.13.2 (2022-06-14)
-------------------

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Set the minimum supported version of Python to 3.8 since many of the
  dependencies such as ``xarray``, ``pandas``, ``rioxarray`` have dropped support
  for Python 3.7.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use `micromamba <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/provision-with-micromamba>`__
  for running tests
  and use `nox <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-nox>`__
  for linting in CI.

0.13.1 (2022-06-11)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- In ``deg2mpm`` function look for ``_FillValue`` and ``nodatavals`` in
  the attributes and if not found, fall back to ``numpy.nan``.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Ensure that the ``deg2mpm`` function uses ``dask`` if the input is ``dask``-enabled.
- In the ``elevation_profile`` function use a bounding box to get DEM and a linear
  interpolation to get the elevation along the profile.

0.13.0 (2022-04-03)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new function called ``query_3dep_sources`` for querying bounds of 3DEP's
  data sources within a bounding box. It returns a geo-dataframe that contains
  the bounding box of each data source and a column ``dem_res`` identifying the
  resolution of the raw topographic data within each geometry.
- Add a new function called ``elevation_profile`` for getting elevation profile
  along a line at a given spacing. This function converts the line to a B-spline
  and then calculates the elevation along the spline at a given uniform spacing.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Remove caching-related arguments from all functions since now they
  can be set globally via three environmental variables:

  * ``HYRIVER_CACHE_NAME``: Path to the caching SQLite database.
  * ``HYRIVER_CACHE_EXPIRE``: Expiration time for cached requests in seconds.
  * ``HYRIVER_CACHE_DISABLE``: Disable reading/writing from/to the cache file.

  You can do this like so:

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    os.environ["HYRIVER_CACHE_NAME"] = "path/to/file.sqlite"
    os.environ["HYRIVER_CACHE_EXPIRE"] = "3600"
    os.environ["HYRIVER_CACHE_DISABLE"] = "true"

0.12.2 (2022-01-15)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a new DEM source to ``elevation_bycoords`` to get elevation from
  the National Map's 3DEP WMS service. This can replace the ``tnm`` source
  since ``tnm`` is not stable.
- Add a new function called ``check_3dep_availability`` to check the availability
  of 3DEP's native resolutions within an area of interest. It returns a ``dict``
  with keys corresponding to the available resolutions and its values are boolean
  values indicating whether the resolution is available or not.
- Replace no data values of ``slope`` in ``deg2mm`` with ``np.nan``, so they do not
  get converted to another value. The output of this function has ``np.float64`` type.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Refactor ``ElevationByCoords`` by using ``__post_init__`` for validating the
  input parameters rather than ``pydantic``'s validators.
- Refactor ``elevation_bygrid`` by using ``get_map`` to get DEM and ``rioxarray``
  for re-projection.
- Add type checking with ``typeguard`` and fixed typing issues raised by
  ``typeguard``.
- Refactor ``show_versions`` to ensure getting correct versions of all
  dependencies.

0.12.1 (2021-12-31)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use the three new ``ar.retrieve_*`` functions instead of the old ``ar.retrieve``
  function to improve type hinting and to make the API more consistent.

0.12.0 (2021-12-27)
-------------------

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Set the request caching's expiration time to never expire. Add two flags to all
  functions to control the caching: ``expire_after`` and ``disable_caching``.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add all the missing types so ``mypy --strict`` passes.
- Improve performance of ``elevation_bygrid`` by ignoring unnecessary validation.

0.11.4 (2021-11-12)
-------------------

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use ``rioxarray`` for dealing with ``GeoTIFF`` binaries since ``xarray``
  deprecated the ``xarray.open_rasterio`` function, as it's discussed
  in this `PR <https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/5808>`__.
- Use ``importlib-metadata`` for getting the version instead of ``pkg_resources``
  to decrease import time as discussed in this
  `issue <https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/5676>`__.

0.11.3 (2021-10-03)
-------------------

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Rewrite the command-line interface using ``click.group`` to improve UX.
  The command is now ``py3dep [command] [args] [options]``. The two supported commands are
  ``coords`` for getting elevations of a dataframe of coordinates in ``EPSG:4326`` CRS
  and ``geometry`` for getting the elevation of a geo-dataframe of geometries. Each sub-command
  now has a separate help message. The format of the input file for the ``coords`` command
  is now ``csv`` and for the ``geometry`` command is ``.shp`` or ``.gpkg`` and must have a
  ``crs`` attribute. Also, the ``geometry`` command now accepts multiple layers via the
  ``--layers`` (``-l``) option. More information and examples can be in the ``README.rst`` file.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Make ``fill_depressions`` function public. This function conditions an input DEM
  by applying
  `depression filling <https://richdem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/depression_filling.html>`__
  and
  `flat area resolution <https://richdem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flat_resolution.html>`__
  operations.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The ``get_map`` function now checks for validation of the input ``layers`` argument before
  sending the actual request with a more helpful message.
- Improve docstrings.
- Move ``deg2mpm``, ``fill_depressions``, and ``reproject_gtiff`` functions to a new file
  called ``utils``. Both ``deg2mpm`` and ``fill_depressions`` functions are still accessible
  from ``py3dep`` directly.
- Increase the test coverage.
- Use one of the ``click``'s internal functions, ``click..testing.CliRunner``,
  to run the CLI tests.

0.11.2 (2021-09-17)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fix a bug related to ``elevation_bycoords`` where CRS validation fails if its
  type is ``pyrpoj.CRS`` by converting inputs with CRS types to string.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix a couple of typing issues and update the ``get_transform`` API based on the
  recent changes in ``pygeoutils`` v0.11.5.


0.11.1 (2021-07-31)
-------------------

The first highlight of this release is a major refactor of ``elevation_bycoords`` by
adding support for the Bulk Point Query Service and improving the overall performance
of the function. Another highlight is support for performing depression filling
in ``elevation_bygrid`` before sampling the underlying DEM.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Refactor ``elevation_bycoords`` function to add support for getting
  elevations of a list of coordinates via The National Map's
  `Point Query Service <https://apps.nationalmap.gov/bulkpqs/>`__. This service is more
  accurate than Airmap, but it's limited to the US only. You can select the source via
  a new argument called ``source``. You can set it to ``source=tnm`` to use the TNM
  service. The default is ``tnm``.
- Refactor ``elevation_bygrid`` function to add a new capability via ``fill_depressions``
  argument for filling depressions in the obtained DEM before extracting elevation data
  for the input grid points. This is achieved via
  `RichDEM <https://richdem.readthedocs.io>`__ that needs to be installed if this
  functionality is desired. You can install it via ``pip`` or ``conda`` (``mamba``).

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Migrate to using ``AsyncRetriever`` for handling communications with web services.
- Handle the interpolation step in ``elevation_bygrid`` function more efficiently
  using ``xarray``.

0.11.0 (2021-06-19)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added command-line interface (:issue_3dep:`10`).
- All feature query functions use persistent caching that can significantly improve
  the performance.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Drop support for Python 3.6 since many of the dependencies such as ``xarray`` and ``pandas``
  have done so.
- The returned ``xarray`` objects are in parallel mode, i.e., in some cases ``compute`` method
  should be used to get the results.
- Save the output as a ``netcdf`` instead of ``raster`` since conversion
  from ``nc`` to ``tiff`` can be easily done with ``rioxarray``.

0.10.1 (2021-03-27)
-------------------

- Add announcement regarding the new name for the software stack, HyRiver.
- Improve ``pip`` installation and release workflow.

0.10.0 (2021-03-06)
-------------------

- The first release after renaming hydrodata to PyGeoHydro.
- Make ``mypy`` checks more strict and fix all the errors and prevent possible
  bugs.
- Speed up CI testing by using ``mamba`` and caching.

0.9.0 (2021-02-14)
------------------

- Bump version to the same version as PyGeoHydro.
- Add support for saving maps as ``geotiff`` file(s).
- Replace ``Elevation Point Query Service`` service with ``AirMap`` for getting
  elevations for a list of coordinates in bulk since ``AirMap`` is much faster.
  The resolution of ``AirMap`` is 30 m.
- Use ``cytoolz`` for some operations for improving performance.

0.2.0 (2020-12-06)
------------------

- Add support for multipolygon.
- Remove the ``fill_hole`` argument.
- Add a new function to get elevations for a list of coordinates called ``elevation_bycoords``.
- Refactor ``elevation_bygrid`` function for increasing readability and performance.

0.1.7 (2020-08-18)
------------------

- Added a rename operation to ``get_map`` to automatically rename the variables to a
  more sensible one.
- Replaced ``simplejson`` with ``orjson`` to speed-up JSON operations.

0.1.6 (2020-08-11)
------------------

- Add a new function, ``show_versions``, for getting versions of the installed dependencies
  which is useful for debugging and reporting.
- Fix typos in the docs and improved the README.
- Improve testing and coverage.

0.1.5 (2020-08-03)
------------------

- Fixed the geometry CRS issue
- Improved the documentation

0.1.4 (2020-07-23)
------------------

- Refactor ``get_map`` to use ``pygeoutils`` package.
- Change the versioning method to ``setuptools_scm``.
- Polish README and add installation from ``conda-forge``.

0.1.0 (2020-07-19)
------------------

- First release on PyPI.
